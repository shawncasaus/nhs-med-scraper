            "Continuous combined hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is a medicine used to treat hot flushes, mood swings, vaginal dryness and other symptoms of the menopause.",
            "It can also prevent weakening bones (oesteoporosis) which is common after the menopause.",
            "Menopause is when your periods stop due to lower hormone levels. It usually affects women between the ages of 45 and 55, but it can happen earlier. It affects anyone who has periods.",
            "Your doctor will usually recommended continuous combined HRT if you are post-menopause (you have not had a period for 1 year or more).",
            "It is not suitable if you have menopause symptoms but are still having periods (perimenopause), or within 12 months of your last period, because it may cause irregular bleeding. In these cases your doctor will usually recommend sequential combined HRT instead.",
            "Menopause symptoms are caused by a drop in the levels of oestrogen and progesterone produced in the ovaries. There are different types of oestrogen and progesterone, called oestrogens and progestogens. Combined HRT uses both to raise the levels of these hormones in your body.",
            "It's important to take both oestrogen and progestogen, unless you've had a hysterectomy (surgery to remove your womb). This is because taking oestrogen-based HRT on its own can thicken the womb lining. This slightly increases the risk of womb cancer. Taking progestogen together with oestrogen reduces the risk.",
            "Continuous combined HRT is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets, capsules and patches.",
            "Currently there are supply shortages of some types of HRT. If the medicine you've been prescribed is not available, a pharmacist or doctor will be able to advise you about using a different brand or type of HRT that is suitable for you."

          "HRT can take up to 3 months to work fully to improve your symptoms.",
          "Common side effects include headache, breast tenderness and vaginal bleeding but these normally improve in the first few months of treatment.",
          "If you feel that the HRT you're taking is not helping your symptoms, talk to a doctor. It can take time to find the right type and dose to suit you.",
          "It's common to take combined HRT for 2 to 5 years, and then try stopping to see if your menopause symptoms have improved. If your symptoms last for longer, your doctor can advise on the benefits and risks of continuing to take HRT.",
          "It's important to see your doctor at least once a year for a check-up and to review whether you need to keep taking HRT."

            "Once your pain is under control, your doctor may swap you to fentanyl patches. This will avoid you having to take tablets or capsules each day.",

            "Sometimes your doctor may prescribe a fentanyl patch with a fast-acting painkiller. This is to manage sudden flare-ups of pain that break through the relief the patches give.",

            "What to do if you forget to take or apply fentanyl depends on which type you're using. Most types of fentanyl are only taken when you need them and so you're unlikely to forget.",

            "If you forget to change your patch, do it as soon as you remember and make a note of the day and time. Then change the patch again after 3 days as usual. If you're very late changing your patch, do not apply a new patch without talking to your doctor first.",

            "There are 2 different types of lithium – lithium carbonate and lithium citrate. It's important not to change to a different type unless your doctor has recommended it. This is because different types are absorbed differently in the body.",

            "However, you must stop taking it if you have symptoms such as loss of appetite, problems with your eyesight or feeling very thirsty. These could be signs of lithium toxicity or an allergic reaction. If this happens it's important to stop taking lithium straight away and get medical help.",

            "If you usually take tablets or slow-release tablets and it's less than 6 hours since you were supposed to take your medicine, take it as soon as you remember. If it's more than 6 hours, just skip the missed dose and take your next one at the usual time.",

            "Utrogestan (micronised progesterone) is a medicine that contains a hormone called progesterone. Progesterone is a type of progestogen that's identical to the hormone your body produces.",
            "Your ovaries produce progesterone and oestrogen until the menopause, when your periods stop. Menopause usually affects women between the ages of 45 and 55, but it can happen earlier. It affects anyone who has periods.",
            "Progesterone is produced during the second half of your menstrual cycle. As you reach menopause, the amount of progesterone and oestrogen that your body produces falls.",
            "Utrogestan is taken along with oestrogen as part of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to relieve the menopause symptoms you may have when your body produces less of these hormones. Taking progesterone with oestrogen is known as combined HRT.",
            "Oestrogen-based HRT can thicken the womb lining. This slightly increases the risk of womb cancer. Taking progesterone together with oestrogen reduces this risk.",
            "Progesterone stops the womb lining from getting too thick, and when you stop taking it (usually for a few days each month) this causes the womb lining to be shed, like a period, which helps to protect you from womb cancer.",
            "You'll need to take combined HRT if you still have a womb.",
            "Utrogestan is only available on prescription. It comes as capsules that you swallow.",

          "HRT can take up to 3 months to fully improve your symptoms.",
          "Common side effects include changes in your periods, breast tenderness and headaches, but these usually improve in the first few months of treatment.",
          "If you feel that the HRT you're taking is not helping your symptoms, talk to a doctor. It can take time to find the right type and dose to suit you.",
          "It's common to take HRT for 2 to 5 years, and then try stopping to see if until your menopause symptoms have improved. If your symptoms last for longer, your doctor can advise on the benefits and risks of continuing to take HRT.",

            "Vaginal oestrogen is a hormone replacement therapy (HRT) medicine that contains the hormone oestrogen. It's used to treat the vaginal dryness and irritation that can happen during the menopause.",
            "Menopause is when your periods stop due to lower hormone levels. It usually affects women between the ages of 45 and 55, but it can happen earlier. It affects anyone who has periods.",
            "The fall in the amount of oestrogen your body produces can cause symptoms. Using vaginal oestrogen can help dryness and irritation but it will not treat other symptoms of the menopause such as hot flushes, mood swings or problems sleeping (insomnia).",
            "Vaginal oestrogen comes as a tablet, pessary, cream, gel or ring that you insert into your vagina. Using oestrogen inside the vagina only is called local HRT.",
            "Usually, if you take or use oestrogen you must also use a progestogen alongside it, to protect your womb. But with vaginal oestrogen, little of the medicine gets into the rest of your body, so you do not need to take progestogen.",
            "If vaginal oestrogen is not enough to treat your symptoms, you can also use a higher dose of HRT.",
            "Vaginal oestrogen is only available on prescription, except the brand Gina (vaginal tablets) which you can buy from a pharmacy.",
            "Other brands of vaginal oestrogen include Vagifem and Vagirux vaginal tablets, Estring vaginal ring, Imvaggis pessaries, Blissel vaginal gel and Ovestin vaginal cream.",
            "Currently there are shortages of some types of HRT. If the medicine you've been prescribed is not available, a pharmacist or doctor will be able to advise you about using a different brand or type of HRT that is suitable for you."

          "It can take up to 3 months to work fully.",
