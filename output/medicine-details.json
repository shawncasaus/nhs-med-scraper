            "Progesterone is produced during the second half of your menstrual cycle. As you reach menopause, the amount of progesterone and oestrogen that your body produces falls.",
            "Utrogestan is taken along with oestrogen as part of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to relieve the menopause symptoms you may have when your body produces less of these hormones. Taking progesterone with oestrogen is known as combined HRT.",
            "Oestrogen-based HRT can thicken the womb lining. This slightly increases the risk of womb cancer. Taking progesterone together with oestrogen reduces this risk.",
            "Progesterone stops the womb lining from getting too thick, and when you stop taking it (usually for a few days each month) this causes the womb lining to be shed, like a period, which helps to protect you from womb cancer.",
